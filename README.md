# zero
Zero is a distributed, no single-point-of-failure time series database. It essentially uses the same principles as Cassandra to store multiple append-only time series, and retrieve them speedily.

Zero was my engineer's thesis, graded A. Thesis is attached, but (due to Polish law) was written in Polish. LaTeX sources are available.
